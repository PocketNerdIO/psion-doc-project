== SERIES 3 PROGRAMMING OVERVIEW

Throughout the Series 3 Programming Guide, reference to the Series 3 machine should be taken to include the Series 3a and the Workabout unless stated otherwise.

See also the Workabout Programming Guide for further information specific to that machine.

=== Programming possibilities

In general terms, there are six different levels at which programs can be written for the Series 3:

* using OPL, creating `.opo` or `.opa` program files
* using CLIB, with user interface restricted to console i/o of the `getchar` and `puts` variety
* using PLIB, again with user interface restricted to console i/o
* using WLIB, accessing the graphics and windowing capabilities of the Window Server
* using Hwif, with its support for menus and dialogs similar to those available in OPL/w
* using HWIM, FORM, OLIB and (for the Series 3a) XADD, the object-oriented DYLs built into the ROM.

All but the first of these uses the C programming language.

For programming in OPL see the Series 3, Series 3a and Workabout Programming manuals, or the _SIBO OPL Software Development Kit_.

For more detailed information about PLIB library routines and the window server see the _PLIB Reference_ and Window Server Reference manuals respectively.

Programming using Hwif is also covered in its own separate manual, _Programming in Hwif_.
This manual is particularly recommended on account of its relevance to the Series 3.

For details of object-oriented programming see the object oriented sections of the C SDK, starting with the _Object Oriented Programming Guide_.

The present manual focuses on features of the Series 3 and Series 3a that are by-and-large unique to these particular computers (as opposed to other computers in the SIBO range, that is, the HC and MC computers).
These features include:

* the difference between `.app` and `.img` forms of program file
* communications between applications and the System Screen
* the specialised form of the command line for applications
* some device drivers unique to the Series 3 and/or Series 3a
* development tools particularly suited to the Series 3 and Series 3a computers.
* writing applications that run on all machines.

Other parts of the SDK that may be found of particular relevance to programming for the Series 3 include:

* the descriptions of file formats used by various applications, in the _Additional System Information_ manual
* a description of the special form of printer driver files used on the Series 3, also in the _Additional System Information_ manual.

Before proceeding further with this chapter, the reader is recommended to be familiar with the basic contents of the General Programming manual.

=== Differences between `.app` files and `.img` files

Strictly speaking, there is no real difference between files with extension `.img` and those with extension `.app`.
For example, although the System Screen usually expects to install `.app` files, it will also, if requested, install suitable `.img` files.

However, by convention a `.app` file contains one or more extra so-called _add-files_ embedded within it, in addition to the core `.img` file itself.
These files may include:

* a `.pic` file providing the icon for the application
* a `.rsc` or `.rzc` file providing the resource file for the application
* a `.shd` file providing the shell data for the application.

Any such add-files can be added into the `.img` file automatically, via the operation of emake.exe, at the time the `.img` file is itself created.
What controls the set of add-files used (if any) is the presence or absence of a suitably named _add-file list_ (`.afl`) file.

==== Add-file lists

An add-file list (`.afl`) file is a text file containing from one to four filenames.
For example, the contents of a file `tele.afl` could be:

 tele.pic
 tele.rsc
 tele.shd

When any `.pr` project file is invoked that leads to the building of `tele.img`, the existence of a file `tele.afl` is checked for.
If such a file is found, the files listed therein are combined with the core `.img` file to form a larger `.img` file as output.
By convention, `.img` files that contain embedded add-files are renamed to `.app`
files.

See the chapter _Building an Application_ in the _General Programming_ manual, for more details.

==== Pre-defined add-file slots

The `RSCFILE` class in the OLIB library can find resource files embedded in a `.app` file, but only if they are placed in the second of the four slots.

The System Screen expects to find a `.shd` file in the _third_ add-file slot of a program being installed, and indeed will refuse to install it if no such data is found there.

The Window Server, however, will find a `.pic` file (or a `.fon` file) at any of the four add-file positions within a `.app`.
In view of the requirements for resource files to occupy the second slot, and for `.shd` files to occupy the third slot, `.pic` icon files are usually placed in the first add-file slot -- as in the above example.

At the time of writing, there is no mechanism to specify a file for (say) the third add-file slot, while omitting the second add-file altogether.
For this reason, it may occasionally be necessary to create and maintain a zero-length file for the second slot.

==== Running programs via RunImg

An alternative to installing a program in the System Screen with its own file list is to run it from the RunImg icon:

* the user presses kbd:[Tab] while the highlight is within the RunImg file list
* the user navigates the file selector until it selects the program file
* the user presses kbd:[Enter] to start this program.

This procedure can be simplified if the program is placed in a top-level \img\ directory, and given the extension `.img`.
In this case, the program will automatically appear as an entry in the RunImg file list.

However, a program run in this way will receive no special command line from the System Screen.
Nor will it receive any Shutdown or Switchfile messages from the System Screen.
(These messages are discussed in the following chapter).

==== Program files with and without icon files

An application can simply not have an icon, although in this case the system screen will simply refuse to install it.
The application can, however, still be run from RunImg, in which case, an empty icon boundary will be displayed in any status window used.

Icon files, such as `tele.pic`, may be produced by a variety of means:

* using the _Iconed_ demo application that can be built using the Hwif part of the SDK or, for the
Series 3a and Workabout, the _Iconeda_ application that is installed in a `\sibosdk\s3atool` directory
* using the Window Server tool `wspcx.exe` on the `.pcx` output of a PC program such as Windows PaintBrush.

The `.pic` file can contain:

* a 24x24 bitmap for a Series 3 icon.
* two 48x48 bitmaps for a Series 3a icon - the first and second bitmaps specify the black and grey planes respectively.
* a 24x24 bitmap for a Series 3 icon followed by two 48x48 bitmaps for a Series 3a icon.

The format of `.pic` files is given in the Bitmaps section in the _Window Server Reference_ manual.

==== Resource files and shell data files

See the _Resource Files_ chapter of the _Additional System Information_ manual for a description of the format and uses of resource files.

Shell data files are discussed in the following chapter.

==== Customised add-files

In most cases, at least one add-file slot will be free for use by the application itself.

One important reason to build an extra file into the `.app` file, rather than leaving such a file separate, is that it diminishes the chance of a user copying the `.app` file from one SSD to another but neglecting to copy a vital associated file at the same time.

==== Finding add-files within a .app file

Ordinarily, applications have no need to find add-files within themselves, since system code takes care of this on their behalf.

One possible exception is when an application needs to access a customised add-file.
In this case, knowledge of the format of the header of a `.img` (or a `.app`) file is required.
In fact, this header just contains the same information as is returned by invoking `edump.exe`.

The header of a `.img` file is described by the `ImgHeader` struct, defined in `epoc.h`.
See the chapter `Processes and Inter-process Messaging` in the `PLIB Reference` manual for a discussion on this struct.

An example of code that attempts to locate a resource file in the second add-file slot of a `.app` file is as follows:

[c,source]
----
GLDEF INT rscfile_rs_init(PR_RSCFILE *self,TEXT *name)
    {
    ImgHeader head;

    /* self->rscfile.offset is zero by default */
    f_open(&self->rscfile.pcb,name,P_FRANDOM|P_FSTREAM|P_FSHARE);
    if (p_read(self->rscfile.pcb,&head,sizeof(head))==sizeof(head))
        {
        if (!p_scmp(&head.Signature[0],"ImageFileType**"))
            { /* we have a .img file */
            if (!(self->rscfile.offset=head.Add[1].offset))
                p_leave(E_FILE_INVALID);
            }
        ...
    }
....
}
----

=== Multi-lingual applications

The topic of multi-lingual applications is discussed in general terms in the course of the _Resource Files_ chapter of the _Additional System Information_ manual.

There are some issues about the set of possible command hot-keys ("menu accelerators"), however, that are particular to the Series 3.

The set of possible accelerators varies from language to language on account of the keyboard changing.

All languages must, however, support the 26 accelerators 'a' through 'z', together with four more.

These additional accelerators are '+', '-', '*', and '/' in most languages.
The only exceptions so far are French and Spanish (and Belgian, which uses the French keyboard):

* French replaces '/' with '?'
* Spanish replaces '*' with '>' and '/' with 'Ã±'.

Applications which fail to take account of these changes when they are translated into another language will find they end up carrying a "lame" accelerator: the accelerator is displayed on the menu, but there is no way for the user to press the required key combination.

=== Environment variables on the Series 3

Environment variables can be a powerful programming resource whilst being, at the same time, potentially anti-social.

There are two aspects to this:

* environment variables consume space in a special RAM segment devoted to them -- the more environment variables are created (and the larger these are), the greater the chance becomes of other applications failing to work properly -- on account of not being able to create _their_ environment variables.
* _name clashes_ are possible -- data stored in an environment variable by one application may get obliterated by another application storing different data to an identically named variable.

With regard to the first problem, all that can be said is that due caution should be observed.
Otherwise, your application may earn itself a bad name.

With regard to the second problem, what is evidently required is some kind of naming convention.

For a full discussion of environment variables see the paragraphs preceding `p_getenv` in the _PLIB Reference_ manual.

==== Avoid `$` signs

The `$` sign is used in names of environment variables created and manipulated by Psion system software.

All external applications should completely avoid using environment variables with '`$`' signs in them -- unless they first secure the agreement of Psion.

The plan is to extend the use of '$' to mean, not just "used by Psion", but rather "licensed by Psion".
Interested software developers who contact Psion will be given a short identifier -- for example, "`$17$`".
A company which receives this identifier could then create environment variables with names such as "`$17$table`" or "`$17$md`", secure in the knowledge that no other responsible developer will also use these names.

In conclusion, '`$`' signs should be avoided in all cases; even where approved by Psion, environment variable names should include '`$`' signs only in their identifier region.
Thus a name of "`$A$17$`" would not be allowed.
Environment variables can of course continue to have "simple" names, such as "`table`" and "`md`", but in this case, the chance of a name clash remains.

=== Series 3 family compatibility

==== Series 3/Series 3a/Workabout compatibility

All Series 3 applications are fully compatible with the Series 3a and Workabout.
These two machines automatically recognise such applications and run them in compatibility mode -- both the icon, as displayed on the system screen, and the display are expanded linearly by a factor of two in each dimension.

In fact an application that wishes to use the full screen capabilities of the Series 3a or Workabout must explicitly turn off the compatibility mode by calling the `wCompatibilityMode` function -- see the _Window Server Reference_ manual for further details.

An application can identify which machine it is running on -- using a call to `p_getlcd` - see the _PLIB Reference_ manual for details, and Compatibility in the General Programming Manual for an example.

Thus it is quite feasible to write an application that runs on the Series 3, Series 3a and the Workabout, using the screen of each machine to the full.
However, care should be taken to ensure that the application does not use any Series 3a or Workabout specific features when running on the Series 3 - the grey scale
or, on the Series 3a, the improved sound facilities for example.
The Workabout also has different keyboard scan codes from the other members of the Series 3 family, (see _Hardware Management_, in the _EPOC O/S System Services_ manual).

==== Compatibility with Series 3c and Siena

===== Programs written for the Series 3

All Series 3 programs can be expected to run without modification on both the Siena and the Series 3c.
The programs will run in compatibility mode, as they do on the Series 3a.

===== Programs written for the Series 3a

Most types of program will run without modification on the Series 3c.

It is likely that most Series 3a programs will need some modification, to take account of the smaller screen size, before they will run on the Siena.
Menus and dialogs in Series 3a programs will, in general, be too wide and will need to be reorganised and/or reworded.
Applications that use a sophisticated layout in their display are likely to need extensive modification before they can be used on the Siena.

Series 3a applications written using the Hwif library, and which use grey lines in their menus, will need to be relinked with a suitably modified Hwif library before they will run on either the Siena or the Series 3c.
This incompatibility is associated with the introduction of small fonts for dialogs on the Workabout and Siena.

Hwif programs that are compiled and linked with a modified Hwif library (see the _Programming in Hwif_ chapter of #this upgrade document#) that is supplied with the upgrade software can run on the Series 3,
Series 3a, Series 3c, Workabout and Siena - provided, of course, that their displays are tailored to the various screen sizes and graphics capabilities of these machines.
