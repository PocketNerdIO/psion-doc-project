== A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE SIBO SDK

=== Introduction

The SIBO SDK consists of a set of floppy disks containing the SDK software and a number of manuals describing the software and the Psion SIBO family of mobile and hand-held computers.
The floppy disks contain the various tools, header files, libraries etc that are required to produce an image (`.img`) file that will run on Psion SIBO machines.

==== Manuals

The SDK manuals supplement the TopSpeed manuals.
In particular you are referred to the TopSpeed C Library reference for the description of standard C (CLIB) library functions.

The SDK contains the following manuals:

[cols="1h,2"]
|===
2+|Volume 1

|General Programming Manual
|This manual.
It describes how to install the SDK, and how to build an application that will run on the SIBO machines.
It also contains some notes on using the TopSpeed C Library reference manual, some discussion on how to copy protect software for SIBO computers, and a potentially very important chapter entitled Fundamental Programming Guidelines.

|HC Programming Guide
|Some documentation particularly oriented around the HC computer range.

|Series 3/3a Programming Guide
|Some documentation particularly oriented around the Series 3 range of machines.

|Workabout Programming Guide
|Some documentation particularly oriented around the Workabout computer.

|EPOC O/S System Services
|Describes the software interrupt interface to the ROM-based system services.
An appendix contains a complete listing of the EPOC service numbers.
This will be of particular use to OPL and assembly language programmers who wish to make direct access to EPOC services.

|Additional System Information
|Describes the MCLink communications software, resource files, WDR printing, various file formats, how to write device drivers, and other miscellaneous topics.

2+|Volume 2

|PLIB Reference
|Describes the Psion PLIB library (this library provides the most direct access to the ROM based system services).

|Window Server Reference
|Describes the window server library WLIB which implements a range of sophisticated graphics operations.

|I/O Devices Reference
|Describes the interface to some of the Epoc device drivers, including those which access the serial and parallel ports.

|The SIBO Debugger
|Describes how to use the SIBO Debugger to debug applications being developed for SIBO computers.

|Hardware Reference
|Describes the basic hardware of SIBO computers.

2+|Volume 3

|Programming in HWIF
|Describes the HWIF library (which contains support -- mainly for the Series3 -- for menus, dialogs, editors, and printing).

|Object Oriented Programming Guide
|Describes the development of applications using Object Oriented techniques.
Its introduction provides an overview of Psionâ€™s Object Oriented programming system and of the OLIB, HWIM, FORM and XADD object libraries.

|ISAM Reference
|Describes the ISAM dynamic library which provides Indexed Sequential Access management for large database files.

|OLIB Reference
|Describes the OLIB object library.

2+|Volume 4

|FORM Reference
|Describes the FORM object library.

|HWIM Reference
|Describes the HWIM object library.

|XADD Reference
|Describes the XADD object library.

==== Where to start

There is a very large amount of information in these manuals -- perhaps too much for any one person to keep it all in their head.
However, few developers will need to make detailed reference to more than around half of the manuals.

The manuals contain many cross references to sections where various topics are discussed in more detail.
Use these cross references to help you find your way around the SDK documentation.
The chapter immediately after this one is probably the best place to start.
Alternatively, start reading the _HC Programming Guide_, the _Series 3/3a Programming Guide_,
the _Object Oriented Programming Guide_, the _Plib Reference manual_ -- or anything that catches your eye as you flick through the pages.

==== The terms SIBO and EPOC explained

A SIBO machine is a battery-powered portable computer that is based on the SIBO architecture.
This architecture is designed to minimise the size, weight and power consumption of the computer.
The key components of the architecture are:

* A sophisticated power management system that selectively powers subsystems under software control
* Solid State Disks (SSDs) that provide fast low-power silicon-based mass storage with no moving parts
* A synchronous serial interface for peripherals running at high speed (Mega bit rates)
* An 8086 class of processor (or any compatible processor such as an 80286)
* Hardware protection of the system from aberrant processes (address trapping of out-of-range writes and a watch-dog timer on interrupts being disabled)
* Real-time clock
* ROM-resident system software
* Graphics LCD display
* A touch sensitive digitising pad that provides a pointing device (used in some models)
* ISDN combo sound system (used in some models).

The hardware architecture is primarily implemented in custom ICs called ASICs.
The SIBO architecture uses surface-mounted static CMOS ICs throughout.
For further information see the _Hardware Reference_ manual.

The EPOC operating system, designed for the SIBO architecture, has the following features:

* preemptive multi-tasking
* MS-DOS-compatible file systems
* installable file systems, including remote file access
* asynchronous services
* support for client-server architectures (used to implement system components such as the file server and window server)
* a comprehensive I/O system with many built-in I/O devices
* dynamically loadable device drivers
* reentrant function library
* multiple processes of the same program share a single copy of the code
* support for object-oriented programming
* code-shared dynamic link libraries.

On SIBO machines, the system software resides on an in-built ROM.
A version of the EPOC operating system also runs on a PC.

See the _PLIB Reference_ manual for more details.

=== Fatal programming errors (Panics)

When the system detects a condition that it believes could only arise from a bug in a the application program, the system terminates the process with a "panic number" in the range 0 to 255 inclusive (where the system is said to "panic the process").
A panic is a fatal exception that causes the process to terminate immediately.
There is no way for applications to avoid being terminated when a panic has been started.
As well as protecting the system from defective applications, the panic system enforces a greater discipline on application code by terminating a process as soon as the condition is detected.

==== Panic numbers

Programming errors detected within different areas of the system code give rise to different panic numbers.
The following table lists the possible panic numbers and the corresponding system code that can give rise to them.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|0 to 80, and 255 |The PLIB library 
|81 to 129 |The Window Server library
|130 to 160 |The OLIB object library
|===

These panic numbers are described in more detail in the appropriate manuals.

Panic numbers in the range 160 to 254 are used by code that is not resident in the ROM (such as the ISAM library).
A given panic number may be used by more than one piece of code; such a panic may therefore have one of a number of causes.
The only definitive way to discover the origin of such a panic is to make use of the SIBO Debugger to catch the panic and then trace it back to its source.

=== C++ and Object Oriented programming

This version of the SDK is compatible with TopSpeed C++ although, at the time of writing, the TopSpeed C++ package is not supplied by Psion as part of any variant of the SDK.

Note that the kinds of classes, and the means of creating and accessing them, in C++ are quite different from those in the Psion Object Oriented programming system.

Regardless of whether you use C or C++ to develop Object Oriented applications, if you wish to use Psion objects you must create instances of them and send messages to them by the mechanisms that are described in the _Object Oriented Programming_ chapter of the _PLIB Reference_ manual and the _Object Oriented Programming Guide_.

If you intend to develop a SIBO application that uses _only_ Psion objects, you may still use C++ as a "better" version of C, without making use of its Object Oriented aspects.

You may, if you wish, use a mix of Psion and C++ classes, provided you make sure that you create and use instances of classes of each kind by the appropriate means.
It is quite acceptable, for example, to use Psion classes for the application manager and user interface, but use C++ classes in the `engine' of an application.
