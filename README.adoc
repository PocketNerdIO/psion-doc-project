= The Psion Documentation Project

== Introduction

This repo is the start of a new documentation project for Psion portable computers.

Currently it only includes information from the 16-bit SIBO range, specifically from the SIBO C SDK.
The eventual aim is to include information about all Psion machines.

It is *VERY EARLY ALPHA*.
I am still trying to work out the best way to format the documents and arrange the files, so everything is likely to change.

== Why AsciiDoc?

I believe it's better suited to writing technical documentation (or any book, for that matter) than Markdown and its myriad variants.
For one thing, there is a single standard for tables and it works really well.
The tooling (AsciiDoctor) is also very flexible and is easily able to generate HTML, PDF and EPUB files.
